        My name is <em>Paolo T. Inocencion.</em> Thanks for visiting my page. I am an International Computer Science Junior student @ Coppin State. I transferred from the University of The District of Columbia last fall. I’ve been living here in Baltimore since ’08 and I am originally from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" >Philippines</a>. This semester I’m taking up COSC 306, 312, 314, and 420 and I’m hoping to graduate this December. This page is created as an assignment for COSC 314 Web Programming class to demonstrate my very limited knowledge of HTML and CSS. This is page is written using my editor of choice, Brackets and uploaded to a web server using FileZilla. I will update this site as I learn along the course.</p>


        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>I like coding, building software, hardware and learning CS stuff while lurking at reddit and stackoverflow.</p>

        <p>I’m a PC gamer, console when I was younger. I also like running, playing football, lifting weights and cycling, until I took an arrow to the knee and my bike stolen.</p>

        <p>I like watching movies, and different TV series on Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, Etc.</p> 

        <p>Music plays a part in my daily routine, I listen to different genres and different eras of great music, from our ancestor’s music to your grandpa’s anthem, Classical to Blues, Heavy metal to EDM, Rap to Hip-hop and even ambient sound if I need to focus or sleep.
        </p> 
        <p>I love drinking whisk(e)y to relax especially Bourbon and Scotch and porter beers too. </p>
        <p>I love eating more that cooking, but I’m the family cook and grill master.  My favorite food is pizza and chicken wings. Any pizzas from the mom and pops to the high-end pizza places but only one chicken wings can satisfy my mortal needs --- HipHop Chicken.

        <div class="caption_center">Black Coffee</div>


        <br><p>My blood type is black coffee positive and I run on coffee a lot to stay awake. Who doesn't? I need to make this paragraph longer so I'm just going to type this here to make that happen.</p>

        <p>Most of all, I love nature and I always try to replicate its beauty using a camera.
