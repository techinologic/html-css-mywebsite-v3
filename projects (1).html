The first paragraph should include a summary of the article. The second paragraph should focus more in-depth on one aspect of the article. Feel free to use additional resources you find on your own. The third paragraph should feature your higher-order thoughts about the in-depth topic - including any concerns, solutions, ideas, etc. you'd like to share. Please use the lower to higher order thinking chart I referred to in class previously to guide your thinking.
